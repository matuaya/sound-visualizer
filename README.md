# terminal-visualizer-ish

Audio visualizer for your terminal. It listens to your mic and shows the volume as bars.<br>

Totally useless and boring — but it _feels_ like a real audio visualizer!

## How to use

```
npx terminal-visualizer-ish
```

You can optionally calibrate the visualizer by providing sound samples so it better adapts to your microphone environment. Or just skip and use the default settings 🎤

## How to stop

⚠️ **To stop the visualizer, press `Ctrl+C` — this is the only way to exit!**<br>
